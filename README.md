# Snappy Mod
For all those who need finer control over where to snap to in Dungeondraft.

# Attention, Work in Progress!
The mod is currently not snapping to any user-defined locations so it's pretty much useless. However feel free to look at the code and give me some help if you wish to.

### Installation.
1. Download the mod
2. Extract the zip into your Dungeondraft mod folder.
3. If you do not have a mod folder yet, the Mods tab will let you choose one.
4. Use the mods tab to select the mod and simply open your map.

### How to use.
- You can find the menu to interact with this mod in the Settings category.
- The mod isn't fully functioning yet, so you literally can't do anything other than hit debug.

### Compatibility.
- No known imcompatiblities as of yet. Please notify me and the other authors if you find any and maybe there will be a compatibility patch in the future.
- The mod is highly dependent on the order of operations and manually adding functionality for multiple tools. Therefore any mods with custom tools may cause unforseen behaviour, such as:
    1. Working perfectly with this mod.
    2. Simply work as intended without any interaction.
    3. Have some functionalities snap to the vanilla grid and others to the modded grid.
    4. A random one of the above based on load order.

### Thanks
